# Machine Learning Based Android-Malware-Detection
## Our goal is to detect Android malware automatically based on machine learning. The project can be divided into three parts.
#### 1. Collect malware dataset from Android Malware Database. We plan to collect 100 Android malwares, and 100 legal apps as training dataset. To guarantee the robustness, we will collect different types of apps, range included game, social media and etc.
#### 2. Dump ICMP packages by tcpdump by python automated script. In this case, to ensure test environment is pure, we would install and test malware one by one. More specifically, we would install apps by adb and extract package list, then run and test apps one by one with Monkeyrunnerâ€™s random operation. After installing one malware into Android device, we will use another laptop to ping this Andriod device and monitor all traffic between certain Android device and laptop. More specifically, we will ping the device and wait for the reply, the delta delay time represents the current traffic condition.  In order to reduce random error, for each malware, we will repeat individual test 100 times via 5 minutes period for each sample. After that we will use wireshark to analyze the package and extract useful information.
#### 3. Train model to distinguish malware from normal apps. First we will try random forest tree algorithm, then we will try different models to find one have best performance. Since we have a relative larger dataset, there is no need to use 10-fold cross validation. We plan to use 70% data as training dataset, 10% as validation dataset and 20% as test dataset.
